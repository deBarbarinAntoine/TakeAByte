# TakeAByte

---

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **`SQL/BIN` Path Preparation:** Ensure you have the full path to the `SQL/bin` directory. This directory contains essential SQL files for initializing the database and managing logs. The path should look like `C://wamp/bin/sql/mysql+version/bin` if you're using wamp, else `C://mysql+version/bin`.


2. **TakeaByte Doc Path Preparation:** Obtain the full path to the TakeaByte doc. The path should look like `C:///path/to/TakeAByte`.


3. **Initialization SQL File:** The initialization SQL file (`init.sql`) is crucial for setting up the initial database schema and configurations. Ensure you have the full path to this file, which should look like `C://path/to/init.sql`.


4. **Master Log SQL File:** The master log SQL file (`master_log.sql`) is used for tracking database changes and updates. Have the full path to this file ready, which should look like `C://path/to/master_log.sql`.


5. **Web Market File:** The Web Market file is the sql file in which the script used to create the database is located. Obtain the full path to this file, which should look like `C://path/to/web_market_file`.


6. **Cookies:** Please assure that your cookies for `localhost:4000` are cleared for test purpose as it's still not implemented in the script.


7. **Database Name:** Please assure that you don't type a database name already in use.


8. **Ready ?:** Once you're all ready , start the `setup_database.bat` in the `INSTALL` folder and follow the instructions.

## Usage
