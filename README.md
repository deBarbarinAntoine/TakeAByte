# TakeAByte

TakeAByte is an online hardware shop made for an assignment at the end of my first year of computer science.
It is a project involving an API and a backend web server made in nodejs and express, with a MySQL database to store all necessary data.

This project was made in collaboration with Nicolas Moyon, who made most of the backend (API and backend web server), while I made the front-end with ejs templates and SCSS.
