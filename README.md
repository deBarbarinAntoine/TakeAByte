# TakeAByte

## Presentation

TakeAByte is an online hardware shop made for an assignment at the end of my first year of computer science.
It is a project involving an API and a backend web server made in `nodejs` and `express`, with a `MySQL` database to store all necessary data.

This project was made in collaboration with **Nicolas Moyon**, who made most of the backend (API and backend web server), while I made the front-end with `ejs` templates and `SCSS`.
