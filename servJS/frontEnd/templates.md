# Template documentation

There are three types of templates:
- `base.ejs`
- pages
- partials

`base.ejs` is the one that contains the head, header and footer of any page used in the website.

It takes a `page` template inside.

pages are the ones used in `base.ejs`.

partials are models used in the pages: they are always called from a `page` template.
